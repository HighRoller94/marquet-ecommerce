## What I learned

I really enjoyed playing around with this project, as it served as my first playground for vanilla javascript. It taught me alot alot about the basics of js, such as for/forEach, manipulating arrays of data, using setInterval and making carousels, as well as creating reusable web components. It was also
my first project using sessionStorage and localStorage, and taught me alot about browser storage. I tried to avoid using libraries
so that I could learn the basics first, and then if it came to it use libaries to speed up development in the future. Overall I was happy with how it turned out, and it was fun to build a cart-like system in basic JS.
